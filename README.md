### Project Description
###### In iteration2, the project implements a comprehensive refactoring from the user interface to the backend. The new version is developed based on the android open source project [Agora](https://gitlab.com/aossie/Agora/): An Electronic Voting Library implemented in Scala , and a new voting application is completed on the basis of the optimization and reconstruction of Agora basic UI and architecture. The app relies on Google's Firebase FireStore service rather than Agora web backend, which enables users to register, log in, vote and get votes in real time by using FireStore to store data.
